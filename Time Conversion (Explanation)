1. Input: You give the program the time in 12-hour format (e.g., "07:05:45PM").

2. Extract Parts: The program splits the time into:

    Period (AM/PM)
    Hour
    Minute and second

3. Convert the Hour:

    If it's AM:

      If the hour is "12", change it to "00" (midnight).
      Otherwise, leave the hour as is.
    If it's PM:

     If the hour is not "12", add 12 to the hour (convert to 24-hour format).

4. Combine: The program combines the updated hour with the minute and second to form the final 24-hour time.

5. Output: It then prints the time in 24-hour format (e.g., "19:05:45").
