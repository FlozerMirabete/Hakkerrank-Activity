1. Set Up (n)
First thing: You gotta tell the computer the size of the matrix (n). If it's a 4 x 4, you type 4. That n number runs everything.

2. Build the Matrix (arr)
We create an empty box called arr to hold the whole grid.
Then, we loop n times. Each time, we read a line of numbers you put in (the row) and stick it into arr. Now you have your full matrix.

3. The Main Job
We send the whole matrix (arr) to the diagonalDifference function. This is where the magic happens.

Inside the Function

4. Tally the Diagonals
We start two counters at zero: sumPrimary and sumSecondary.
We run one loop from i = 0 up to n-1. This single loop hits both diagonals:
Primary (Top-Left to Bottom-Right): Add the number at arr[i][i] to sumPrimary. (It's always row i, column i).
Secondary (Top-Right to Bottom-Left): Add the number at arr[i][n - i - 1] to sumSecondary. (The column count goes backward as the row count goes forward.)

5. The Final Answer
Once the loop finishes, we just subtract the two totals and make sure the answer is positive (that's the "absolute difference" part).
The function spits that number back out.

6. Finish
The program prints that final positive number. Done.
