Sorting the List:

The array arr is sorted in ascending order. This makes it easy to pick the smallest and largest 4 numbers.

Minimum Sum:

We take the first 4 numbers from the sorted list (arr.Take(4)) and sum them. This will give us the minimum sum.

Maximum Sum:

We skip the first number (arr.Skip(1)) and then take the next 4 numbers. This will give us the maximum sum.

Printing the Results:

Both the minimum and maximum sums are printed in the same line, separated by a space.
