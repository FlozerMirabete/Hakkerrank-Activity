The Goal: The aVeryBigSum Function The main goal is to finish the function named aVeryBigSum. This function's entire job is to take a list of very large whole numbers (called ar, which uses the long data type) and figure out the total sum of every number in that list. It must return a large number (LONG_INTEGER).

The Missing Step The function is blank. To fix it, you need the one line that adds everything in the list ar together and sends the result out:

C#

public static long aVeryBigSum(List<long> ar)
{
    return ar.Sum();
}
This fixed function takes the list of large numbers, adds them all up using the .Sum() tool, and returns the grand total as a long.

The Main Program (The Setup) This part runs the show, handles getting the large numbers as input, and manages the output.

Get Input The program first reads the size of the list (arCount). Next, it reads the line that has all the very big numbers (space-separated). It converts these into the large number type (long) and saves them into the ar list.

The Call The program says: long result = Result.aVeryBigSum(ar);. This sends the fully prepared list of large numbers (ar) to the function you fixed. The total (which is also a very large number) that comes back is saved into a variable called result.

Finish The program takes that final result number and prints it to the output. Done.
