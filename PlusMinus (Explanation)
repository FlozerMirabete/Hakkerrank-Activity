It asks how many numbers you’re gonna type (n).

Then you type that many numbers, like -4 3 -9 0 4 1.

The code looks at each number one by one.

If it’s bigger than 0 → it’s positive.

If it’s smaller than 0 → it’s negative.

If it’s 0 → well, it’s zero.

It keeps track of how many of each type there are.

When it’s done, it figures out what fraction of the numbers were positive, negative, or zero.

Like, if half are positive, that’s 0.5.

Then it prints those fractions, making sure each one has 6 numbers after the dot (like 0.500000).
