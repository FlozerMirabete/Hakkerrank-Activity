1. Input: You give the program 5 numbers in a line, like 
   1 2 3 4 5

2. Sort: The program arranges those numbers from smallest to largest.  
   Now we know the smallest number is`1 and the largest is 5.

3. Sum: The program adds up all the numbers together:

   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

4. Calculate the Minimum Sum: The minSum is the total sum minus the largest number (5)

   15 - 5 = 10

5. Calculate the Maximum Sum**: The maxSum is the total sum minus the smallest number (1):

   15 - 1 = 14

6. Output: It then prints the two sums on the same line, separated by a space:  
   10 14
